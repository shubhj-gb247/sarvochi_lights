Works with led, able to control both white and warm lights using irlz44n mosfet.
Had to pull out an extra wire from the capacitor -ve terminal to get a stable 
ground as white -ve and warm -ve were used for pwm.


TODO: try ledc driver with custom pwm frequency to avoid flickering when controlling lights.
